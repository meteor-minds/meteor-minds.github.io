      <p>Meteor Minds is a forum for members of the London tech community to come together to discuss mental health issues. Our goal is to foster an informal network of people with mental health issues, and their allies, as well as to educate the community-at-large.</p>
      <p>Meteor Minds is a safe and supportive space. We don’t discriminate or judge. When you’re at a Meteor Minds event, you’re amongst friends.</p>
